  <h1 class ="flash">Some information About Me</h1>
  <p class = "flash">My name is John Stratton and I grew up in Lancaster County, PA (yes that is Amish Country). I was an active child while growing up and played many sports but my calling was a goalkeeper for soccer. After graduating from high school I went to college and subsequently joined the Army in 2013. I currently am transitioning out of the Army and am looking forward to an exciting career as a programmer. My favorite color is blue. </p>
